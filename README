= Scoped Admin

This extends (spanner's forked version of) multi_site to bring more
scoping into the admin interface. Layouts, snippets and users are
all site-scoped at a very low level, so a normal user will see the normal 
radiant interface with no idea that there are other sites in the same
system. Only the admin user will be able to choose another site in the 
admin interface: when they do, they move to a completely separate set of
pages, layouts, snippets and users.

The site-choice strapline - here changed a bit - now appears at the top of
any site-scoped admin index view, as well as the main page index view.
