= Scoped Admin

This extends (spanner's forked version of) multi_site to bring more
scoping into the admin interface. Layouts, snippets and users are
all site-scoped at a very low level, so a normal user will see the normal 
radiant interface with no idea that there are other sites in the same
system. Only the admin user will be able to choose another site in the 
admin interface: when they do, they move to a completely separate set of
pages, layouts, snippets and users.

###Installation

Reader requires the spanner fork of multi_site, but apart from that it declares its dependencies. At the moment Ray doesn't know about this extension so you probably want to do something like this:

  rake ray:extension:install name="multi-site" hub="spanner"
  git submodule add git://github.com/spanner/radiant-scoped-admin-extension.git vendor/extensions/scoped_admin
  rake radiant:extensions:scoped_admin:migrate

If you've got a lot of extensions to install, it's a good idea to install everything else first, do the migrations, make sure it's working and then install scoped_admin last. It will probably cause tests to fail in other extensions, for example, by making their objects invisible in the database.

###Next

This is getting fairly solid but there are still a few awkwardnesses for 
the administrator who wants to get at resources on a site other than the
one she's logged into. It nearly all works. Possibly next:

* scoped settings
* scoped paperclipped
